# API
I made a simple user api by using Spring Boot application for user response in backend and use the MySql Workbench for the data storage. My api port number is http://localhost:9090/api/users. If any one want to access it should be used the ip addrss instead of the localhost:9090. I worked on 10.100.17.251 Ipv4.
